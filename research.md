**Soil carbon and water dynamics**

**Nitrogen saturation in northeastern USA forests**  
Human activities have increased the amount of reactive N in the
environment, and temperate forests have been showing signs of N
enrichment and saturation.

**Changing winters in the northeastern USA**  
The vernal transition is a critical period of temperate and boreal
ecosystem function that is brought on by increasing air temperatures and
rapid snowmelt at the end of winter.
