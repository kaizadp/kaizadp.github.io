#### Soil carbon and water dynamics  
Soil moisture is an important driver of soil carbon fluxes, and drying-rewetting events influence C stabilization in soils. Drought events are increasing in intensity and frequency, and it is therefore crucial to understand soil C fate and transport as a soil dries and is subsequently rewet.

#### Nitrogen saturation in northeastern USA forests  
Human activities increased the amount of reactive N in the environment in the twentiest century, and temperate forests have been showing signs of N enrichment and saturation. The Bear Brook Watershed in Maine, USA (BBWM) is one of the longest running forested watershed manipulations studying the effects of chronic nitrogen (N) and sulfur (S) enrichment and environmental change on forest ecosystem processes. Over the last three decades, research has been conducted on soil, stream, and vegetation response to the manipulation and ambient changes in the physical and chemical environment. Long-term monitoring included hydrology, stream chemistry, quantitative soil sampling, biomass and vegetation nutrient inventories. Current research is focusing on understanding the biotic and abiotic character of recovery to acidification in a changing climate. The study has demonstrated the importance of long-term research showing that multi-year and multi-decadal responses can yield different outcomes.

#### Changing winters in the northeastern USA   

Global environmental change in northeastern North America is resulting in warmer winters with reduced snow accumulation. Soils under a thin snowpack are more likely to experience freezeâ€“thaw cycles, disrupting carbon and nitrogen transformations. There has also been a significant decline in the duration of winter, the number of snow-covered days, and the timing of snowmelt. These projected changes in winter dynamics will likely have significant effects on soil biogeochemical processes, which extend beyond the snow- melt period.
